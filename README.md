Hello World!

Been working in and following arts & technology for 5 decades.
Did some mature student studying in my early thirties: BSc. Computing from 1984; BA Fine Art from 1990.
Learnt a bit of server-side programming in Perl and MySQL while freelancing in web design in the early 2000's
A little PovRay programming for 3d graphics, and some very basic coding in keykit for music generating.
I work in commercial graphics and actively continue to deveop my painting, Romanian language study and music (tenor sax), skills.

This is a dipping of the toe into the GitHub pool to maintain my programming connections ... lets see how this develops.
